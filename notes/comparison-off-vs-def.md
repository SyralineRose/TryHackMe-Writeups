## ⚔️ Offensive vs Defensive — Reflections  

- **Mindset**  
  - Offensive: Feels like finding the weaknesses of an opponent and solving puzzles.  
  - Defensive: Feels like analysing data to find evidence and clues to protect the system.  

- **Main Tools**  
  - Offensive: dirb / gobuster, nmap, exploitation scripts  
  - Defensive: SIEM, log analysis, firewalls, antivirus  

- **Biggest Challenge**  
  - Offensive: Finding the right balance of thinking inside and outside the box.  
  - Defensive: Risk of missing the right alert or deploying the wrong response, and the challenge of staying ahead with threat intelligence.  

- **Takeaway**  
  - Both sides need each other: learning one makes me better at the other.  
  - Working hand in hand provides the strongest protection for a system.
