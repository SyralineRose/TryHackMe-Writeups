## 🔍 Overview  
It was interesting to see how networks can be organised and how permissions are managed at an admin level. Active Directory provides so many possibilities for managing users and applying security policies. I explored the differences between Organisational Units and Security Groups, and how they work together.

## 📝 Notes  

### Key Concepts  
- **Domain Controller** → the server that runs Active Directory and manages authentication/authorisation.  
- **Organisational Unit (OU)** → a container for organising users, groups, and computers within a domain.  
- **Security Groups** → used to assign permissions to sets of users or computers.  
- **Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)** → the main tool to manage AD objects.  
- **Authentication** → AD commonly uses Kerberos (tickets) and LDAP (directory access).  

### Observations  
- I didn’t realise how heavily Active Directory was used in my previous corporate jobs, it was everywhere in the background.  
- I enjoyed experimenting with different policies, though I got stuck at one point with the control panel permission task because I set the policy in the wrong place. That mistake actually helped me understand OUs better.

## 🧩 Key Takeaways  
- Active Directory is a single point of control for users, groups, and permissions but also a single point of failure if compromised.  
- Learning AD is important for both attackers (common target) and defenders (needs to be secured).  
- Even simple misconfigurations in AD policies can have big impacts on user access and security.
