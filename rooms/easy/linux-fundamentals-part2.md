## 📝 Notes  

### File and Directory Management  
- Learned to use `touch` to create files and `mkdir` to create directories.  
- Practiced `cp`, `mv`, and `rm` for moving, copying, and deleting.  

### Permissions  
- Used `ls -l` to inspect permissions.  
- Practiced `chmod` to change read/write/execute rights.  
- Understood the difference between user (u), group (g), and others (o).  

### Processes  
- Explored running processes with `ps` and `top`.  
- Learned to kill processes using `kill <PID>`.

## 🧩 Key Takeaways  
- File management on Linux is fast once the commands are second nature.  
- Permissions are crucial for security and often a source of privilege escalation in CTFs.  
- Process monitoring (`ps`, `top`) is a must-have skill for both defense and attack.
