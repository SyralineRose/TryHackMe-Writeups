## 🔍 Overview  
I learned the seven layers of the OSI model and how each of them works. I also learned about encapsulation, the pros and cons of TCP vs UDP, and when each protocol is best used.

## 📝 Notes  

### Key Concepts  
- 7 layers:  
  1. Physical  
  2. Data Link  
  3. Network  
  4. Transport  
  5. Session  
  6. Presentation  
  7. Application  
- Mnemonic: the *Wreck-It Ralph Breaks the Internet* scene, where Ralph and Vanellope travel from the plug (Physical) to the search engine (Application).  
- TCP vs UDP comparison.  

### Observations  
- I didn’t realise how much happens at each layer, and how they are all interconnected to give the user a seamless experience.

## 🧩 Key Takeaways  
- Knowing how the layers work makes troubleshooting network issues much easier.  
- I’m curious about how pentesting tools might take advantage of TCP/UDP. For example, could assumptions about UDP’s unreliability be exploited to bypass checks or sneak traffic through?
