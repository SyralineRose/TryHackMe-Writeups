## 🔍 Overview  
I learned about the pros and cons of different network topologies like Star, Bus, and Ring. The room also introduced subnetting and how it benefits large networks. I explored how ARP works to request identifiers and how devices reply with their MAC address. Finally, I learned the DHCP process for automatically assigning IP addresses.
